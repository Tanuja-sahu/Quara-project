     <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
   Poet's name --> 
     <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3> \
    <!-- Poem -->
      <p>I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
    Who said- "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
  stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, <br>
  Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
  The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
  And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
  My name is <span> Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br>
  Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
  of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br>
  The lone and level sands stretch far away." <br>
